# Objective

To perform customer segmentation using unsupervised learning and discover purchasing patterns through market basket analysis on the Online Retail dataset.


# Problem Statement

How can we segment customers based on their purchasing behavior and identify meaningful associations between purchased products to support data-driven marketing and business decisions.

# Business Understanding

The Online Retail company aims to better understand its customer base and their buying habits. By segmenting customers and identifying product purchase patterns, the company can personalize marketing efforts, optimize inventory, enhance cross-selling strategies, and improve overall customer satisfaction and retention.

# Dataset

The Online Retail dataset is a transactional dataset that contains all purchases made between December 1, 2010 and December 9, 2011 by customers of a UK-based non-store online retailer. The company specializes in selling unique all-occasion gifts, and a significant portion of its customers are wholesalers.

Each record in the dataset represents an individual product purchase and includes fields such as:

* InvoiceNo: Invoice number (unique for each transaction)
* StockCode: Product/item code
* Description: Name/description of the product
* Quantity: Number of units purchased
* InvoiceDate: Date and time of the transaction
* UnitPrice: Price per unit (in GBP)
* CustomerID: Unique identifier for each customer
* Country: Country where the customer is based

This dataset is commonly used for customer analytics tasks such as segmentation, purchase pattern analysis, and association rule mining.
